### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is OWL. I've been working with testnets for over two years as a validator for PoS/PoW. I promise constant monitoring, great uptime, and quick updates. Passionate about working with testnets, understanding how blockchains tick, and designing user-friendly interfaces. I love finding and fixing bugs to make things run smoothly.
